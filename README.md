# Web Development Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

## Stage 1 | Game in the Browser Console
### What I learned:
- Prompt player to input value, check value using validation methods
- Take input and convert to lowercase string to make function read easier
- Randomize string by the length using Math function
- Use if else statement to check winner by matching values with .filter
- Use for loop to play up to 5 rounds before deciding the winner
- Use console.log to consistently test for correct outputs

## Stage 2 | Game with Simple UI - [Play Here](https://jasminepvo.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)
### What I learned:
- How to use selectors to target nodes in DOM with only JavaScript --> document.querySelector("") 
- How to add element to DOM using only JavaScript with .textContent 
- How to add, remove classes to div in order to make image grow larger when active/hovering
- How to add function to my images when there is a click --> .addEventListener('click', () => {});
- Refactoring code
- How to create a new branch to avoid breaking code then merge branches using Git
